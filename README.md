# TABARC Recon Command Center

This is a side-panel Chrome extension for structured search and recon work.

Its *not* a scanner.
It does not automate attacks.
It helps you think more clearly while searching.

## Design philosophy

- Explicit over clever
- Manual over automated
- Local data over cloud sync
- Boring code that you can trust

If you are looking for something flashy,
this repo will probably annoy you.

## What this does

- Build advanced search queries
- Organise them per project
- Run template packs step-by-step
- Track canary tokens defensively
- Import packs from known-good sources

## What this deliberately avoids for now

- Obfuscation tricks
- Filter bypasses
- Exploit chains
- "one click pwn" nonsense

Those things age badly.

## Future ideas (maybe)

- Notes per query
- Result screenshots
- Operator autocomplete
- Timeline view

Or not. We'll see.

## Install

Chrome -> Extensions -> Developer mode -> Load unpacked

Point it at the repo root.

That's it.
